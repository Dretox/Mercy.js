# Mercy.js
WIP bot for Discord.

Author: Wesley Rhodes

Version: v0.01 05/15/2016

Mercy is a very basic bot currently, but I have hopes that it'll develop into something much more over time.  I'm still getting used to the Discord.io API.  I plan to keep this bot open-source for the duration of this personal project, hopefully it'll be a learning point for others who want to get into it.  I plan on keeping my project well documented.  Thank you for your time.
